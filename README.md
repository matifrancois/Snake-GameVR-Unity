## What it is

This is a Unity project with the files of the mithical game: Snake in this case is the VR aproach of that game. In this game you can controll the snake with a bluetooth controller while you move your head to see where your prey is. The game allows you to play in firs person or in thirth person mood. And select multiple dificulty levels.
Also allows you to use the bluetooth controller configuration of your choice the first time you run it.

This project was made for the the Virtual Reality subject at ITBA (Technological Institute of Buenos Aires).

## Requirements

To edit the game you only need Unity installed on your computer, preferably the 2019.4.17 version to avoid versioning problems.

To play the game either on the computer or in the cell phone, you need a bluetooth controller, the one we use to play is showed on the next image.
